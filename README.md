# DensityEstimation

# TODO(dakshs): write exactly what this does ...
# Roughly speaking, this kinda compares using "Merton Jump Diffusion" and "Geometric brownian motion" (GBM) models for stock market data.
# The latter is like conventional BS, drift rate, blah blah.
# TODO(dakshs): where does KDE come in??
# GBM: Independent increments, stationary increments, etc = definition of Weiner process.
